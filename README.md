# React Accordion Exercise

This is a simple React project that implements an accordion component to demonstrate how to manage state and toggle content visibility within an accordion-like interface. The project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **Flowbite** for additional UI components.

## Features

- Click to expand/collapse accordion items.
- Each item can be toggled independently, displaying or hiding content.
- Built using React functional components with hooks.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling.
- **Flowbite** for pre-built UI components (like the Accordion).
